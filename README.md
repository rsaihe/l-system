# l-system
Renders fractal patterns using L-systems and Python's turtle graphics.

Use `$ python3 lsys.py -h` for help with using the command line tool.

Several example fractal patterns have been provided in the [examples folder](examples/). E.g. the Koch curve fractal may be rendered by doing `$ python3 lsys.py examples.koch_curve`.
